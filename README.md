# SIH 2025: AI-based Dropout Prediction and Counseling System

## Overview
This repository contains the **basic prototype** of our Smart India Hackathon project.  
The core functionality focuses on **predicting dropout risk** for students based on attendance and test scores.  

**Main Prototype Features:**
- Input: Attendance and test scores (CSV or structured format)
- Output: Risk category for each student (High / Medium / Low)
- Prediction accuracy display
- Color-coded risk display (optional UI)

## Tech Stack / Requirements
- **Python 3**
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` → data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` → machine learning model
  - `streamlit` → optional UI (minimal, to show predictions)


## Branches
- main                → Stable branch for approved code
